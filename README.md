# Digivice
The project is crafting a digivice like device. 
It's a handheld virtual pet like or RPG like video game controlled by a arduino UNO micro controller.
The code plans to utilze a .96" Oled display, three micro switches, a sd card slot. 
in later versions i would like to include a rotary encder and bluetooth connectability.
